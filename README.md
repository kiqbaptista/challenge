# API CHALLENGE

This repository contains all files to crearte all necessary resources in Azure Cloud to deploy an API .NET CORE.




## Installation

Install and configure credentials with Azure Cloud and AZ CLI to run locally.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan 
terraform apply
```


PS: The challenged was not concluded with all exigencies. 

I couldn`t find a sample API which uses Database for persistency.

All resources were created using terraform best practices and reusable modules.
